# Taxi_ShareIty

**Problem**:
Students of our community face the problem of not being able to share a cab even though they are traveling to the same destination at the same time .By carpooling the fare for each individual gets dropped by a huge amount and this brings out a positive effect to the environment. 

**Solution**:
This application tries to solve this problem my creating an interactive application which creates events by grouping students based on their destination and time for pick-up and notifies them.

**IDE**
The above application's front end is constructed using netbeans.
